1. Outer loop loops through 10 times. The nested loops goes through 6 times. 10 times times the 6 inside is 60 total iterations.

2.Outer loop loops through 6 times, where the nested loop executes 15 times. 6 of the outside multiplied by the 15 on the inside is 90 times.

2. Exercise 2 An algorithm that can detect edges could be a loop which could compare sourrounding pixels on every side. If the a pixel is within a certain range of the pixel the loop is on then move to that pixel, and then compare again. If it passes a certain number of pixels that get considerably different then seperate the region.
